🌍 Comprehensive Summary of download_sentinel2_data.ipynb & base.py 🌍
This workflow downloads Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, preprocesses it, and applies a U-Net deep learning model to delineate field boundaries.

🛰️ 1. download_sentinel2_data.ipynb (Sentinel-2 Data Download)
This Jupyter Notebook is responsible for authenticating, filtering, and exporting Sentinel-2 imagery from Google Earth Engine (GEE).

🔹 Workflow:
🔵 Step 1: Authentication & Initialization
✔️ Uses !earthengine authenticate to authorize access.
✔️ Initializes Google Earth Engine with ee.Initialize().

🟢 Step 2: Region of Interest (ROI) Definition
✔️ Defines multiple study areas using ee.Geometry.Polygon():

🗺 Vietnam & Cambodia (Initial training regions)
🏔 Bhutan (Fine-tuning region)
🌍 Netherlands (Commented out)
✔️ The Cambodia region is currently selected.

🟡 Step 3: Filtering Sentinel-2 Data
✔️ Loads Sentinel-2 data collection:

python
Copy
Edit
dataset = ee.ImageCollection('COPERNICUS/S2')
✔️ Filters data based on:

📅 Time Range
📍 Spatial Boundaries (Region of Interest)
☁ Cloud Cover (Images with minimal cloud interference are selected)
🟠 Step 4: Processing Satellite Imagery
✔️ Selects relevant spectral bands:

🔴 RGB
🌿 NIR (Near-Infrared)
🔵 SWIR (Shortwave Infrared)
✔️ Applies cloud masking techniques using the QA60 band.

🔴 Step 5: Exporting Data
✔️ Saves the processed Sentinel-2 images to:

☁ Google Drive (Export.image.toDrive())
📦 Google Cloud Storage (Export.image.toCloudStorage())
🟣 Step 6: Visualization (Optional)
✔️ Uses folium maps to visualize Sentinel-2 images.
✔️ Can generate:

🖼 RGB composites
🌿 NDVI vegetation analysis
🔥 False-color representations
🤖 2. base.py (U-Net AI Model Configuration)
This script configures and manages the deep learning pipeline for boundary delineation.

🔹 Key Components:
🔵 (a) Enumerations (StrEnum)
✔️ Defines study areas:

🌏 ASIA (Default)
🇳🇱 NL (Netherlands)
✔️ Defines data sources:

🛰 S2 (Sentinel-2)
✔️ Defines model types:

🧠 SATELLITE_UNET
🔬 CUSTOM_UNET
🟢 (b) Model Training & Fine-Tuning
✔️ Deep Learning Model: U-Net
✔️ Purpose: Delineates field boundaries from satellite images.
✔️ Training Strategy:

Phase 1 🗺 Vietnam & Cambodia (Initial training)
Phase 2 🏔 Bhutan (Fine-tuning for enhanced accuracy)
✔️ Why Bhutan?

Different topography requires fine-tuning to improve segmentation accuracy.

🇳🇱 Netherlands	'best/linux_s2_nl_from_scratch_True_8_120_26_10_001_20230509-101508.h5'
✔️ Automatic Model Selection:

python
Copy
Edit
if self.from_scratch and self.source == Source.S2 and self.area == Area.ASIA:
    self.predict_weights_file = Base.BEST_ASIA_S2_SCRATCH
